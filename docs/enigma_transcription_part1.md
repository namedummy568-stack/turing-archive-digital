# Enigma Machine: A Historical Transcription - Part 1

## Introduction to Enigma
The Enigma machine was a series of electro-mechanical rotor cipher machines developed and used in the early to mid-20th century for encrypting and decrypting secret messages. Enigma was employed extensively by Nazi Germany during World War II to encrypt military communications.

## Key Components
The standard Enigma machine consisted of several key components:
- **Keyboard:** Used to input plaintext.
- **Rotor Mechanism:** A series of rotating wheels (rotors) that performed the substitution cipher. Most military Enigma machines had three to four rotors.
- **Reflector (Umkehrwalze):** A unique feature that sent the electrical current back through the rotors by a different path, ensuring that a letter could never be encrypted to itself.
- **Lampboard:** Displayed the encrypted (or decrypted) letter.
- **Plugboard (Steckerbrett):** Allowed for additional letter pair swaps, significantly increasing the machine's security.

## Operational Procedures
Operating the Enigma machine involved several steps to ensure secure communication:
1.  **Initial Setup:** Operators would configure the machine according to daily settings, which included rotor order, ring settings, and plugboard connections.
2.  **Message Encryption:** Each letter typed on the keyboard would pass through the plugboard, then the rotors, then the reflector, back through the rotors, and finally through the plugboard again before illuminating a letter on the lampboard. This illuminated letter was the ciphertext.
3.  **Rotor Stepping:** After each letter was typed, one or more rotors would step, changing the substitution alphabet for the next letter. This mechanical movement was crucial to Enigma's complexity.
4.  **Message Decryption:** The receiving operator, with an identically configured Enigma machine, would type the ciphertext, and the plaintext would be illuminated on their lampboard.
